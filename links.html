<p>A library catalogue is expected to satisfy every kind of bibliographic demand made on it. 
Therefore, a good library catalogue should provide information about the Main title, sub title, 
statement of authority (author and his collaborator(s)), editor statement, place of publication, 
name of Publisher, date of publication, pagination, illustration, ISBN, series, subjects and 
tracings. When library materials are cataloged in a careful and complete manner, access is 
provided for the library patrons and staff to all sources of information on a particular topic, by 
a particular author, or in a particular format, that the library possesses. The better the access, 
the more use the collection receives, and the more satisfied the patron is in his/ her search for 
information in the library.
The library catalog might be compared to the index of a book. The index provides the reader 
with a way to find information in the book without having to read every page. The index tells 
the reader the page on which the information about a specific subject can be found. The 
library catalog does the same thing. It tells the library user exactly where materials meeting 
their specific needs can be found, with the call number of the book corresponding to the page 
number in an index.
The process of cataloguing involves 3 major activities namely: descriptive cataloguing, subject 
cataloguing, and authority control.
Descriptive cataloguing involves applying a standardized set of rules to record the title, 
authorship, and publication data for a work, describe the physical extent of the work, add 
bibliographic notes as necessary, and add access points for persons or entities associated with 
the creation of the work. The access points are keywords use to search the items.
